5. **Explain the concept of Object-Oriented Programming.**
   Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and methods. It emphasizes modularity, reusability, and abstraction.

6. **What are the basic principles of OOP?**
   - **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within one unit (class).
   - **Inheritance:** Creating new classes from existing ones.
   - **Polymorphism:** Ability to process objects differently based on their data type or class.
   - **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.

7. **What is inheritance in Java?**
   Inheritance is a mechanism where one class acquires the properties and behaviors of another class. It allows for code reusability and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

8. **What is polymorphism?**
   Polymorphism is the ability of a variable, function, or object to take on multiple forms. In Java, it allows methods to be used in different ways, such as method overloading and method overriding.

9. **What is encapsulation?**
   Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class) and restricting access to the inner workings of that class.

    - **Method:** Used to perform operations. It has a return type and can have any name.

13. **What is method overloading?**
    Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class.
